# TREXIO

[![build](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio/actions/workflows/actions.yml)
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/TREX-CoE/trexio)

TREX library for efficient I/O.


## Minimal requirements (for users):

- Autotools             (autoconf >= 2.69, automake >= 1.11, libtool >= 2.2)
- C compiler            (gcc/icc/clang)
- Fortran compiler      (gfortran/ifort)
- HDF5 library          (>= 1.8)	[optional, recommended for high performance]


## Installation procedure from the tarball (for users):

1. Download the `trexio-<version>.tar.gz` file
2. `gzip -cd trexio-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -`
3. `cd trexio-<version>`
4. `./configure`
5. `make`
6. `make check`
7. `sudo make install`


**Note: on systems with no `sudo` access, one can replace `./configure` with `./configure prefix=${PWD}/_install` in order to execute `make install/uninstall` commands without `sudo` privileges.**


## Additional requirements (for developers):

- python3       (>= 3.6)
- Emacs         (>= 26.0)
- SWIG          (>= 4.0)

## Installation procedure from the GitHub repo clone (for developers):

1. `git clone https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio.git`
2. `cd trexio`
3. `./autogen.sh`
4. `./configure`
5. `make`
6. `make check`
7. `sudo make install`

## Compilation without the HDF5 library

By default, the configuration step proceeds to search for the [HDF5 library](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/HDF5).
This search can be disabled if HDF5 is not present/installable on the user machine.
To compile without HDF5, append `--without-hdf5` option to `configure` script. For example,

`./configure --without-hdf5`

## Linking to your program

The `make install` command takes care of installing the TREXIO shared library on the user machine.
Once installed, add `-ltrexio` to the list of compiler options.

In some cases (e.g. when using custom `prefix` during configuration), the TREXIO library might end up installed in a directory, which is absent in the default `$LIBRARY_PATH`.
In order to link the program against TREXIO, the search paths can be modified as follows:

`export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_trexio>/lib`

(same holds for `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). The `<path_to_trexio>` has to be replaced by the prefix used during the installation.

If your compilation relies on some build tools (like Autotools or CMake), feel free to use the built-in solutions to locate and link external dependencies automatically.

In Fortran applications, make sure that the `trexio_f.f90` module file is included in the source tree.
You might have to manually copy it into your program source directory.
The `trexio_f.f90` module file can be found in the `include/` directory of the TREXIO source code distribution.

**Note:** there is no need to include `trexio.h` header file during compilation of Fortran programs.
Only the installed library and the Fortran module file are required.


## Naming convention

The primary TREXIO API is composed of the following functions:

- `trexio_open`
- `trexio_write_[group]_[variable]`
- `trexio_read_[group]_[variable]`
- `trexio_has_[group]_[variable]`
- `trexio_close`

where `[group]` and `[variable]` substitutions correspond to the contents of the `trex.json` configuration file
(for more details, see the corresponding [documentation](https://trex-coe.github.io/trexio/trex.html) page).
For example, consider the `coord` variable (array), which belongs to the `nucleus` group. The TREXIO user can write or read it using `trexio_write_nucleus_coord` or `trexio_read_nucleus_coord` functions, respectively.

Note: the `[variable]` names have to be unique only within the corresponding parent `[group]`.
There is no naming conflict when, for example, `num` variable exists both in the `nucleus` group (i.e. the number of nuclei) and in the `mo` group (i.e. the number of molecular orbitals).
These quantities can be accessed using the corresponding `trexio_[has|read|write]_nucleus_num` and `trexio_[has|read|write]_mo_num`, respectively.

  The TREXIO library defines a standard format for storing wave functions,
  together with an C-compatible API such that it can be easily used in any
  programming language.


  The source code of the library is available at
  https://github.com/trex-coe/trexio
  and bug reports should be submitted at
  https://github.com/trex-coe/trexio/issues.
